### Python Dictionary: All About Python

This Python project is a simple interactive dictionary containing information about various Python concepts, keywords, and functions. The dictionary is designed to help developers quickly find definitions, code examples, and outputs related to specific Python terms.

#### How It Works

1. **Adding New Words:**
   - To add a new word and its details to the dictionary, enter "**add" when prompted to search for a word.
   - Provide the new word, its definition, and a code snippet related to the word. End the code input with a line containing only '###'.
   - Finally, enter the expected output of the code snippet.
   - The new word will be added to the dictionary for future searches.

2. **Searching for Words:**
   - Enter a word to search for its details in the dictionary.
   - If the word is found, the program will display its definition, code snippet, and output.
   - If the word is not found, the program will provide suggestions for similar words or partial matches.

3. **Similar Word Recommendations:**
   - If the entered word is not found and has more than two characters, the program will suggest similar words or partial matches based on fuzzy matching.
   - If there are recommended similar words, you will be informed that you are probably searching for one of them.

#### Python Dictionary Sample Data

The current version of the Python dictionary contains data for the following words:

1. **abs(x):**
   - Definition: Return the absolute value of a number.
   - Code Example: `abs(x)`
   - Output: The output will be the absolute value of the number.

2. **aiter(async_iterable):**
   - Definition: Return an asynchronous iterator for an asynchronous iterable.
   - Code Example: `aiter(async_iterable)`
   - Output: This will return an asynchronous iterator.

#### How to Use

1. Run the Python script, and the main loop will start.
2. Enter a word to search its details in the dictionary.
3. If you want to add a new word, enter "**add" to switch to add mode and follow the instructions.
4. To exit the program, enter 'q' at any time.

#### Additional Notes

- The dictionary uses fuzzy matching to provide recommendations for similar words when the entered word is not found.
- Code snippets are provided for better understanding of Python concepts and keywords.
- The dictionary can be expanded by adding more words and their details to the `all_about_python_data` dictionary.
